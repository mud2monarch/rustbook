# Project: Command-Line Calculator

Create a command-line calculator that takes in basic arithmetic expressions as input and evaluates them. You can start with simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Outline

- [x] Create a new Cargo project using `cargo new calculator`.
- [x] Define an enum to represent the different operations (e.g., Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).
- [x] Take in user input. 
- [x] Write a function to parse the user input (a string) into an operation and two operands (numbers).
- [x] Implement the logic to perform the operation based on the enum value.
- [x] Handle errors for invalid input, division by zero, etc.
- [x] Use Cargo to build and run the program.

## Additional Features

- Support for more advanced operations like exponentiation, modulus, etc.
- Allow users to enter multiple expressions and evaluate them sequentially.
- Implement a simple memory system to store and recall previous results.

## Learning Objectives

This project should help you practice the following concepts:

- Enums and pattern matching
- Functions and function arguments
- Error handling
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Cargo and project structure
